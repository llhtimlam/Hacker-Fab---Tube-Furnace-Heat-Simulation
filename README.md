# Pseudo-3D/2D Cylindrical Finite Volume Method (FVM) – Lumped Element Model Hybrid Heat Simulater

A customized heat simulation model developed for small-scale tube furnaces, where traditional commercial thermal analysis tools are inadequate due to severe time step constraints imposed by the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition.

This hybrid model combines a pseudo-3D/2D cylindrical Finite Volume Method (FVM) with a Lumped Element approach, optimizing both computational efficiency and physical accuracy.

## Current System: **Pseudo-3D/2D Cylindrical 5-Layer Tube Furnace System Design**

This simulation models a **5-layer concentric tube furnace system** with precise heat transfer physics:

### **Layer Structure (from center outward):**

```
Layer 1: AIR (Sample Space)          │ r = 0 → mm
Layer 2: QUARTZ GLASS                │ r = mm → mm
Layer 3: ANTHAL COIL (embedded)      │ r = mm → mm  (heating zone)
Layer 4: IMPERIAL CEMENT             │ r = mm → mm
Layer 5: LYRUFEXON CERAMIC FIBER     │ r = mm → mm

Layer 7: SEALED AIR GAP              │ r = mm → mm
Layer 7: ALUMINUM 5052               │ r = mm → mm
```

### **Heat Transfer Flow Analysis:**

#### **1. Heat Generation (Layer 4 - Kanthal Coil):**
- **Power Input**: 480W electrical power
- **Heating Zone**: Z = 25.4mm to 279.4mm (254mm span)
- **Distribution**: 39 physical turns → 39 computational positions (continuous coverage)
- **Temperature**: 
- **Heat Mechanism**: Joule heating (I²R losses) converted to thermal energy

#### **2. Heat Conduction Path:**

**Radial Heat Flow:**
```
Coil (480W) → Cement → Glass → Air (sample)
            ↓
    Ceramic Fiber (insulation)
            ↓
    Reflective Casing (radiation barrier)
            ↓
    Air Gap (thermal break)
            ↓
    Aluminum Enclosure → Ambient
```

**Axial Heat Flow:**
```
Cold Zone (Z=0-25mm) ← Heat Conduction → Heating Zone (Z=25-279mm) ← Heat Conduction → Cold Zone (Z=279-304mm)
```

#### **3. Heat Transfer Mechanisms:**

**A. Conduction (Primary):**
- **Radial**: Through glass (k=1.4 W/m·K), cement (k=0.6-1.85 W/m·K), ceramic fiber (k=0.045-0.42 W/m·K)
- **Axial**: Along glass tube length, distributing heat from coil zone to cold zones
- **Temperature Dependence**: All thermal conductivities vary with temperature

**B. Convection:**
- **Inner tube**: Natural convection (h=5 W/m²·K) - sample space to glass
- **Air gap**: Natural convection (h=5 W/m²·K) - thermal isolation
- **Outer surface**: Natural convection (h=10 W/m²·K) - enclosure to ambient

**C. Radiation:**
- **Glass surface**: High emissivity (ε=0.88-0.94) - significant radiation at high temperatures
- **Reflective casing**: Low emissivity (ε=0.02-0.05) - **radiation barrier** (95% reflection)
- **Aluminum enclosure**: Low emissivity (ε=0.05-0.09) - minimal heat loss

#### **4. Heat Losses:**

**Primary Heat Loss Paths:**
1. **Radial losses**: Through insulation → air gap → enclosure wall → ambient
2. **Axial losses**: Through cold zones at tube ends
3. **Radiation losses**: Surface radiation (minimized by reflective casing)

**Heat Loss Reduction Strategies:**
- **Ceramic fiber insulation**: 102.3mm thick, very low conductivity (k=0.045-0.22 W/m·K)
- **Reflective barrier**: 95% radiation reflection, prevents radiative losses
- **Air gap**: 30mm thermal break, prevents direct leak to ambient atmosphere

### **Boundary Conditions:**

#### **Inner Boundary (r=0, centerline):**
```
∂T/∂r = 0  (symmetry condition)
Convection to Inner Glass Tube Space
Q = h·A·(T_glass - T_sample)
Lump node temperature change regards to heat flux
dT/dt​ = Q/mCv​

```
#### **Internal Region (r=0, multi-layer cylinderical region):**
```
Conduction across internal cell
∂T/∂t = 1/ρCv·(​​∂/∂r​(k(T)·∂T∂r​))
where k(T) at interface is treated with weighted average from interpolated k
k(T) = 1/((k1/Δr1)+(k2/Δr2))⁻¹
```
#### **Heating Zone (Coil positions):**
```
480W distributed over 39 positions
Q = 480W/V_smeared 
where
V_smear = π·r2²·r1²·z
dT/dt​ = V_cell·Q/mCv​
```
#### **Intermediate Boundary (Reflective surface):**
```
Combined convection + radiation across layer (T unknown°C)
Q = h·A·(T_surf - T_air) + ε·σ·A·(T_surf⁴ - T_casing⁴)
Lump node temperature change regards to heat flux
dT/dt​ = Q/mCv​
```
#### **Outer Boundary (enclosure surface):**
```
Combined convection + radiation to ambient (25°C)
Q = h·A·(T_air - T_ambient) + ε·σ·A·(T_casing⁴ - T_ambient⁴)
Lump node temperature change regards to heat flux
dT/dt​ = Q/mCv​
```


### **Key Assumptions:**

# Quasi-Steady-State Radiation

- Radiation heat transfer is modeled using a quasi-steady-state grey body approximation, with constant surface emissivity assumed over time.
- Radiation exchange is considered to reach steady conditions within each time step, and is decoupled from transient conduction behavior.
- Only surface-to-surface radiation is modeled; no absorption, scattering, or transmittance occurs through material layers, which are treated as perfectly opaque.
- The air medium is non-participating in radiation; it does not absorb, emit, or scatter thermal radiation.
- Back radiation from colder surfaces is neglected, and view factor geometry is not considered, reducing the radiation model to a one-way, unidirectional heat transfer mechanism.
- No radiation exchange is considered across the multi-layer cylindrical region; thermal conduction is the dominant heat transfer mechanism within the solid structure.

# Perfect Thermal Contact

- No thermal contact resistance is considered at interfaces between adjacent material layers.
- Interfaces are assumed to be in perfect thermal contact, allowing continuous and uninterrupted heat conduction across boundaries.
- Thermal properties are consistent across interfaces, with no temperature drop or discontinuity in heat flux between layers.

# Uniform Coil Heating

- Consistent volumetric heat generation is applied uniformly within the designated heating zone.
- Resistive heating elements (e.g., heating coils) are assumed to produce a uniform radial power distribution along their axial length.
- The helical geometry of coils and any localized heating effects (e.g., hotspots or concentrated nodes) are neglected, simplifying the model to a spatially uniform heat source.
- Implementation of Gaussian-distributed heating profiles is reserved for future model versions to capture localized power variations more accurately.

# Simplified Thermal Environment and Convection Modeling

- Convective heat loss is modeled using Newton’s law of cooling, with no external fans or forced airflow; only natural convection is considered.
- The air domain is treated as a uniform lumped node, which reaches thermal equilibrium quasi-instantaneously within each time step (quasi-steady-state assumption).
- A fixed, user-defined convective heat-transfer coefficient is used; no empirical correlations or dynamic calculation of 
h is included.
- No computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or air movement modeling is performed; airflow and buoyancy effects are not resolved.
- The thermal response of the air is based on a constant-volume, ideal gas approximation, with thermal diffusivity interpolated at each temperature step.
- No enthalpy changes (e.g., from phase change or air moisture) are included in the air domain; only sensible heat (via temperature) is considered.
- No mass flow or heat loss is included within the sample air space, but the framework allows for future integration of pressurized mass flow or open-system behavior.

# Material Homogeneity Within Layers

- Each material layer is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic, with uniform thermal properties throughout its volume.
- Spatial variations in material composition, porosity, or fiber alignment within a single layer are not considered.
- Localized thermal anomalies (e.g., hot spots, thermal bridges, or short circuits) caused by microstructural inhomogeneities are neglected.

# No Chemical or Phase Reactions

- The model simulates pure heat transfer without coupling to any chemical reactions or material transformations.
- Effects from air chemistry, oxidation, combustion, pyrolysis, decomposition, or thermal degradation are excluded.
- Phase changes (e.g., melting, vaporization, condensation) and associated latent heat effects are not modeled.
- All materials are assumed to remain in their initial solid phase throughout the simulation.

# Adiabatic Axial Boundary (z-axis)

- The furnace is modeled as a segment of an infinitely long cylinder wrapped with finite dimension of heating element. This setting trace heat propagation in the cold zone and simplifies the domain by neglecting end effects and axial heat loss.

- No heat flux is permitted through the axial boundaries. This assumption neglects end effects and simplifies the domain to focus on radial and circumferential heat transfer.

- However, the model allows for some degree of axial temperature profiling within the active heating region, enabling more accurate representation of local gradients while maintaining adiabatic conditions at the boundaries.
